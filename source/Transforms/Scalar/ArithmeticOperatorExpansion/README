Tranformation:		ArithmeticOperatorExpansion

In order to use this transformation for a C program, "aoe-sr.h" header
must be included:

	#include "aoe-sr.h"
	#include "somefile.h"
	
	int FuncYouWantToTransform(int a, char b)
	{
		return a * (b << 4) + b * 8;
	}
	
The transformation finds all operators and, if possible, replaces them with
calls to subroutines that require access to functions declared in "aoe-sr.h".
If this header is not included beforehand, the transformation won't do anything.
